*. Animation on building extraction/slicing.
	- Draw a white building 3D model, and then fly two thin line to slice the
		the model to a 2D image, move it on the screen
	- The old model will be black out a thin slab, 
	- Draw another one, do the same thing until 4 slices
*. Animation on building construction --> tapered and extrusion
	- Draw a demo house with a door on front of it.
	- Two extrusion + one tapering will create this house.
*. Animation on BPA algorithm
	- Draw the circle turning around a point until reach to another one.
*. The contribution slide

*. Re-do the sliced images - with new size 1024 x 392, not old one: 933 x 392 for ACCV

------ Q/A -----

*. why HD, not other measurement?
*. why so short time between defense?
	1. this timeline can be met only if everything goes smoothly. If not, it cannot be met
	2. We have put a lot of efforts on this work in the past several years. 
	   We tried all kinds of ideas and techniques to conquer this problem, and 
	    now we have found an effective way to solve it. We don't want to take the
	    exam too early when we are not sure the results.
