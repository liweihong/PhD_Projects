*Figure of color face images:*
:

1. based on the building_toolbar plugins, manually choose the view.


2. The images are obtained by PrntScrn, and then crop it using parameters
   
   starting point: 1572 x 1064 (not calibratable)
   
   size : 1320 x 932

:
*Figure of Error measurement images:*
:

1. based on the transformation of

(begin code)
   $instance.transform! Geom::Transformation.rotation [512, 200, 100], [1, 0, 0], 3.1415*0.05
   $instance.transform! Geom::Transformation.rotation [512, 200, 0], [0, 0, 1], 3.1415*1.18
   $instance.transform! Geom::Transformation.translation [-120, -280, 0]
   $instance.transform! Geom::Transformation.scaling 0.5
(end code)  

2. The images are obtained by PrntScrn, and then crop it using parameters
   
   starting point: 230 x 1058
   
   size : 1314 x 922

:
*Figure of DXF images:*

1. - The files of BPA_250_*.png were created from "My Documents"/BPA_250.dxf
2. - The file BPA_250_top1.png was created from IR.dxf
3. - 1222 x 526  (image size for top view)
