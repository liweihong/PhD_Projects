Topic: Code glu for Matlab, c++, c, etc.

Think Matlab code as a shell script.

* include all kinds of code for algorithms, c/c++/java...
* when a GUI needed, use Matlab to show the results.
* use system() or !command to issue a command.
* by doing this way, two prons: faster, and easy debugging; cons: not good for parameters passing. may use sscanf to pass the data through files.

Topic: Read some survey papers?

To gain the overview in this field
* range data processing
* building restruction
* line fitting

Topic: Resolution adjustment parameters

sample density; non-linear(High SNR);

* The density of sampling in vertical direction.
* Using non-linear function, such as Bazier, instead of HT only

Topic: 2D image geometry reconstruction

For a particular layer, refer to its prevous and next layer to fitting lines.

Topic: 3D reconstruction

software package and cross-section

* Use SketchUp or ETH paper <Buildings Modeling Papers>, to get its software package?

* How about cross section, namely both horizontal and vertical layers.

Topic: Noise removal & data recover

Image enhancement based on symmetry line and adjacent layers

Compute one symmetry line (e.g., x=261), and from adjacent layers to remove the noise for a particular layer.

Group: To-do List

Topic: Schedule next meeting.

Send an email to George for meeting, discuss the following.

* Possible publication in small conference.
* project details.
